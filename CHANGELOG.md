# Changelog

## 0.4.31

Synced to upstream `vercel/chat@4.31.0`. The mapped-core **test** files (`packages/chat/src/*.test.ts`) are byte-identical between the `chat@4.30.0` and `chat@4.31.0` tags, so the fidelity re-pin to `chat@4.31.0` is string-only (732/732 mapped-core tests still pass, 0 missing); the core **source** delta is the `LinkButton` stable-id field (below). The headline is the **Linear agent-sessions** mode, plus the **Teams SDK-free primitive subpaths**, the **Slack 4.31** changes, **Telegram rich messages**, and a Python-only opt-in **`ThinkingChunk`** stream type. Sets `UPSTREAM_PARITY = "4.31.0"`.

### Headline: Linear agent-sessions mode (issue #151)

Full port of upstream's Linear agent-sessions interaction model, delivered across five PRs (L1–L5). Because no official Linear Python SDK exists, every `@linear/sdk` call is reproduced as **raw GraphQL** over the existing `_graphql_query` helper and **schema-hardened field-by-field against Linear's published GraphQL schema** (`linear/packages/sdk/src/schema.graphql`).

- **L1 — types** (#168). `LinearAgentSessionThreadId`, the `mode: "agent-sessions" | "comments"` config (default `"comments"`), the `kind`-discriminated raw-message variants (`comment` / `agent_session_comment`), and the `AgentSessionEvent` webhook payload types.
- **L2 — thread-id** (#170). Anchored `linear:{issue}:c:{comment}:s:{session}` / `linear:{issue}:s:{session}` encode/decode with a strict decode order; existing thread-id forms stay byte-identical so cross-SDK state is preserved.
- **L3 — webhook parse + routing** (#171). The `AgentSessionEvent` branch with mutually-exclusive mode gating (agent-session events flow only in `agent-sessions` mode, comment events only in `comments` mode), `_parse_message_from_agent_session_event` (created/prompted actions + null-return/warn paths), app-ownership guard, and `get_user_name_from_profile_url`.
- **L4 — emit** (#172). `post_message` / `start_typing` / `stream` route through raw `agentActivityCreate` / `agentSessionUpdate` mutations (lowercase `AgentActivityType` enum, `content: JSONObject!`, `ephemeral` included only when set); streaming flushes markdown deltas as `response`/`thought` activities and maps `task_update`/`plan_update` chunks to `action`/`error` activities and session-plan updates.
- **L5 — fetch** (#173). `fetch_messages` dispatches agent-session threads to `_fetch_agent_session_messages` (raw `agentSession(id:)` + `comments(filter:{parent})` with forward/backward pagination); `edit_message`/`delete_message` raise append-only errors for session threads.

The schema-hardening caught two live-tenant-breaking selection bugs before they shipped (`AgentActivity` exposes the `agentSession` relation, not a scalar `agentSessionId`; `AgentSession` likewise has no scalar `issueId`). The mutations/queries are confirmed against the published schema but **not yet exercised against a live Linear agent-session tenant** — documented in `docs/UPSTREAM_SYNC.md`.

### Teams: SDK-free primitive subpaths (chat@4.31, commit `8c71411`)

New runtime-free Teams subpaths mirroring upstream's `@chat-adapter/teams/*` exports: `teams/api` (Bot Connector — token grant, post/update/delete message, typing, create conversation), `teams/graph` (Microsoft Graph — channels, messages, pagination), `teams/format` (Teams text/mention/HTML↔Markdown), `teams/webhook` (read/parse, continuation/user/attachment extraction, mention detection), `teams/cards` + `cards_input` (card → Adaptive Card + input parsing), and `teams/modals` (modal → Adaptive Card + dialog-submit parsing). Each network-facing primitive carries an SSRF/token-leak host gate: `call_teams_connector_api` (serviceUrl Bot Framework allowlist) and `call_teams_graph_api` (host pinned to `graph.microsoft.com`, also guarding followed `@odata.nextLink` cursors).

### Slack 4.31 (commit `f801985`, PR #155)

- **`@mention`-inside-URL fix.** Bare `@handle`s inside `http(s)` URLs (paths, query strings, fragments) are no longer rewritten into `<@handle>` mentions (which corrupted the link), via a URL-span exclusion pass.
- **`web_client_options`** config — forwarded to both the default and per-token `slack_sdk` `WebClient`s to tune the underlying HTTP client (timeout, `retry_handlers`, headers), with per-client header isolation. (Maps to slack_sdk kwargs rather than `@slack/web-api`'s axios options — documented divergence.)
- **Stable link-button `action_id`** — `LinkButton(id=…)` now flows to the Slack block `action_id` instead of always deriving it from the URL.

### Telegram: rich messages (commit `4662309`)

Character-for-character port of the new `rich.ts` (Telegram rich-message wire types → Markdown + plain text) as `telegram/rich.py`, plus the rich-message/media type family (`TelegramRichText`/`RichBlock`/`RichMessage`, animation/audio/location/video/voice), native `sendRichMessage`/`sendRichMessageDraft` threading through post/edit/stream with a rich→regular fallback, and a `/slash`-command router.

### Core: `LinkButton` stable id + opt-in `ThinkingChunk`

- **`LinkButton(id=…)`** (chat@4.31, commit `171657a`). Optional action identifier for platforms that report link clicks (matches the `Button`/`Select` `id` convention). The JSX-runtime half of the same commit has no Python equivalent (no JSX runtime) and is documented as such.
- **`ThinkingChunk`** (Python-only, opt-in, default-off; supersedes PR #39, landed in #169). A **separate** `ThinkingChunk(type="thinking", content=str)` stream-input type surfaces AI-SDK `reasoning`/`reasoning-delta` parts. **`StreamChunk` is not widened** — it stays byte-identical to upstream's three variants, so consumers referencing it are unaffected; `ThinkingChunk` is accepted only at the stream boundaries via the `StreamInput = str | StreamChunk | ThinkingChunk` alias. Emitted only when a caller opts in (`emit_thinking=True`); the default stream and persisted `Message` are byte-identical to upstream, so cross-SDK state stays compatible. Gives chinchill a first-class path to stream agent thinking to Slack/Teams without intercepting the model stream out-of-band.

### Not ported (documented)

- **`chat/adapters` static catalog** (new `./adapters` subpath). Upstream's SDK-free adapter/env-var metadata registry is addressed by npm package names and includes ~13 vendor-official adapters this SDK doesn't ship, so it isn't meaningfully portable verbatim; a Python-native equivalent would be a new feature with no current consumer need. Documented in `docs/UPSTREAM_SYNC.md`; deferred demand-driven.

## 0.4.30

Synced to upstream `vercel/chat@4.30.0`. The mapped core (`packages/chat/src`) is content-identical between the `chat@4.29.0` and `chat@4.30.0` upstream tags, so this wave is all adapter work: a **new Twilio adapter**, a **Telegram native-streaming** port, a **Slack primitives-subpath** wave, a batch of **WhatsApp / Slack / Google Chat** fixes, and the headline — the **Teams adapter migration to the official `microsoft-teams-apps` SDK** (issue #93, delivered across four PRs). Sets `UPSTREAM_PARITY = "4.30.0"`; CI fidelity re-pinned to `chat@4.30.0` (732/732 mapped-core tests still pass, 0 missing).

### New adapter: Twilio (SMS / MMS / Voice)

- **`chat_sdk.adapters.twilio`** (vercel/chat#558; PR #142). Twilio Programmable Messaging adapter (10th platform): inbound message webhooks with `X-Twilio-Signature` HMAC-SHA1 verification (`hmac.compare_digest`), outbound SMS/MMS through the Messages REST API (hand-rolled over an injectable transport — no official `twilio` SDK, mirroring upstream), 1:1 DM threads keyed `twilio:{sender}:{recipient}`, plus standalone `api` / `webhook` / `voice` helpers (TwiML builders, call + transcription parsing). New extra: `chat-sdk-python[twilio]`. Imports stay lazy so the package loads without `aiohttp` installed.

### Teams adapter: migration to the official `microsoft-teams-apps` SDK (issue #93)

The hand-rolled Bot Framework REST + JWT stack is replaced by the official Microsoft Teams Python SDK (`microsoft-teams-apps` ≥ 2.0.13, added to the `[teams]` extra), mirroring upstream `@chat-adapter/teams@4.30.0`. Landed as four PRs:

- **PR 1 — inbound + auth** (#143). New `adapters/teams/bridge.py`: a `BridgeHttpAdapter` implementing the SDK `HttpServerAdapter` protocol routes already-authenticated webhooks through the SDK `App`. JWT validation now runs through the SDK's `TokenValidator` (RS256 + audience + Bot Framework issuer via the live JWKS) in place of the hand-rolled `_verify_bot_framework_token` block. Graph reads stay hand-rolled (no `msgraph-sdk` / `[graph]` extra).
- **PR 2 — outbound** (#144). `post_message` / `start_typing` route through `App.send`; `edit_message` / `delete_message` route through `App.api.conversations.activities(...).update` / `.delete`. Per-thread service-URL routing retargets the SDK `ApiClient`'s service-url chain (validated against the SSRF allow-list). The camelCase wire dict is still returned as `RawMessage.raw`, preserving the public contract (attachment shape, file delivery, returned id).
- **PR 3 — native streaming** (#145). DM streaming uses the SDK's native `IStreamer` (`microsoft-teams-apps` `HttpStream`) via `app.activity_sender.create_stream(...)` and `stream.emit(...)` per chunk, replacing the hand-rolled Bot Framework streaming wire format. The SDK owns the streamType/streamSequence framing, the inter-flush throttle (~500ms, 429-safe), and 429 retry. Atomically unwinds the two transitional public-type divergences (`RawMessage.text`, `update_interval_ms`) that PR 3 made unnecessary.
- **PR 4 — release cut** (this entry). Version bump to `0.4.30`, fidelity re-pin to `chat@4.30.0`, docs, and the `@chat-adapter/teams@4.30.0` version-label normalization.

The residual adapter-level divergences (we keep the SDK as the auth + transport layer but route the authenticated activity ourselves through a lenient `CoreActivity`; the streamer is closed in our own `_handle_message_activity` `finally` because our bridge owns dispatch) are documented in `docs/UPSTREAM_SYNC.md`.

### Adapter ports — Telegram, Slack

- **Telegram: native DM draft streaming** (vercel/chat#340; PR #140). DMs stream via the `sendMessageDraft` Bot API method (the draft bubble updates in place, throttled to `update_interval_ms`, default 250ms), then a regular `sendMessage` persists the final text; non-DM threads return `None` before consuming any chunks so the SDK's post+edit fallback handles groups/channels. Adds a shared `with_telegram_markdown_fallback()` retry-without-`parse_mode` path wrapping `post_message` / `edit_message` / `send_document` / `send_attachment`.
- **Slack: webhook + primitives subpaths** (vercel/chat#538, #547, #548, #555, #559; PR #139). New runtime-free `chat_sdk.adapters.slack.webhook` (and `slack.api`) subpaths for lower-level Slack request verification, signed-body reading, and Events/slash/interactive payload parsing into typed dataclasses. The adapter now verifies through the shared `verify_slack_request` / `verify_slack_signature` primitives (the inline `_verify_signature` method is removed, matching upstream); the slack package `__init__` is now lazy (PEP 562) so importing a subpath does not pull in the full adapter runtime. The new `slack/api` primitives carry SSRF/token-leak guards (`send_slack_response_url` + `fetch_slack_file` host allowlists).

### Adapter fixes — WhatsApp, Slack, Google Chat

- **WhatsApp: typing-indicator support** (vercel/chat#320; PR #141). `start_typing` resolves the latest inbound message id from the `ThreadHistoryCache` and posts a `typing_indicator` payload (also marking the message read); Graph API default bumped v21.0 → v25.0; `_graph_api_request` and the typing-indicator failure path raise `AdapterError` instead of `RuntimeError`.
- **Slack / Google Chat: 4.30 rendering fixes** (vercel/chat#523, #553, #573; PR #141). Includes collapsing redundant autolink formatting for Google Chat email/`mailto:` links (port of upstream `177735a`).

#### Python-specific (divergence from upstream)

- **Twilio media-download SSRF guard.** `rehydrate_attachment` validates the rehydrated media URL (https + Twilio-owned host) inside the download closure before forwarding the account SID / auth token as HTTP Basic, where upstream `fetchTwilioMedia` GETs the URL blindly. Folded into the existing `rehydrate_attachment` URL allowlist non-parity row (Slack / Teams / Google Chat / **Twilio**); enforces `CLAUDE.md`'s SSRF rule. Regression: `tests/test_twilio_adapter.py::TestRehydrateAttachment::test_media_downloader_refuses_untrusted_hosts`.

### Pre-existing parity gaps closed (4.30 audit)

A pre-ship parity audit (the CI fidelity check covers only the mapped CORE `packages/chat` tests, never the adapters) surfaced 9 gaps present since 0.4.29 — the `chat@4.29.0` and `chat@4.30.0` tags are content-identical for the mapped core — and all but one (Linear agent sessions, deferred to 4.31) were closed in this wave, across four PRs:

- **Google Chat: clear `cardsV2` on edit-to-plain-text** (PR #148). BUG — editing a card message down to plain text left the old card stranded on the message; `edit_message` now sends an explicit empty `cardsV2` so the card is dropped (streaming finalization is the common trigger). Plus **`Select` / `RadioSelect` → `selectionInput` widgets**: these card elements now render as Google Chat `selectionInput` widgets and the selected option is read back from `formInputs`.
- **Teams: ChoiceSet auto-submit fan-out** (PR #149). BUG / contract break — an Adaptive Card `Action.Submit` carrying multiple input keys now fires one `process_action` per input key, so each `on_action(input_key)` handler runs, instead of a single `__auto_submit` dispatch that no handler matched. Plus **`list_threads` / `post_channel_message`** (were raising `ChatNotImplementedError`, now implemented) and **`api_url` / `TEAMS_API_URL`** for a custom Bot Framework endpoint (GCC-High / sovereign cloud).
- **`api_url` custom-endpoint config across Slack / Discord / GitHub / Linear** (PR #150). Custom base URLs for GovSlack / Enterprise Grid / GitHub Enterprise / self-hosted Linear; an empty string falls back to the default, matching upstream's truthy-spread default. Plus **GitHub public `get_installation_id()`**.
- **Core: root `chat_sdk` re-exports the deprecated `chat/ai` type aliases** (PR #147). `AiMessage`, `AiMessagePart`, `ToAiMessagesOptions`, … resolve from the package root again (they had moved to `chat_sdk.ai`); `chat_sdk.ai` stays the canonical home.

**Documented exceptions.** 0.4.30 matches `chat@4.30.0` *with documented exceptions*. The **Linear agent-sessions** surface (#151) is the largest single gap from the audit and is deferred to the 4.31 wave. `adapter-web`, plus the GitHub / Linear native-client (`octokit` / `linearClient`) and `message.subject` halves, remain documented Known Non-Parity in `docs/UPSTREAM_SYNC.md`. The 4.31 wave is tracked in #152.

## 0.4.29 (2026-06-12)

Synced to upstream `vercel/chat@4.29.0` (release commit `6581d31`, May 18 2026; upstream never tagged `chat@4.27.0`/`chat@4.28.0`). Headlines: **Meta Messenger adapter** (9th platform), **`chat/ai` tool factories** (`create_chat_tools`), **`callback_url` on buttons and modals**, **Transcripts API + `thread_history` rename**, **`burst` concurrency strategy**, a Slack feature wave (verifier precedence flip, external installation providers, native `markdown_text`, `web_client`), the upstream adapter-hardening security pass, and a Python floor bump to 3.12. Sets `UPSTREAM_PARITY = "4.29.0"`; CI fidelity re-pinned to `chat@4.29.0`.

### Upstream parity ports — core (`packages/chat`)

- **`callback_url` on buttons and modals** (vercel/chat#454). New `src/chat_sdk/callback_url.py` plus plumbing through cards, modals, chat, channel, and thread: card buttons and modals can carry a `callback_url` that the SDK POSTs to when the action/submit fires, alongside regular handlers. Serialized wire keys stay camelCase (`callbackUrl`) for cross-SDK state compatibility.
- **Transcripts API + per-thread cache rename to `thread_history`** (vercel/chat#448). `MessageHistoryCache` → `ThreadHistoryCache` (module `message_history` → `thread_history`) with back-compat shims at the old import path and config names (new name wins when both are set, matching upstream's `?? config.messageHistory` fallback). The persisted state key prefix `msg-history:` is **unchanged** (renaming would orphan existing data — upstream kept it too). New Transcripts surface for cross-platform per-user history; `ChatConfig.transcripts` requires `ChatConfig.identity` and raises on misconfiguration, matching upstream's guard.
- **`message.subject` + `fetch_subject` adapter hook** (vercel/chat#459, PR #131). `MessageSubject` dataclass, optional `BaseAdapter.fetch_subject(raw)` hook, lazily-resolved cached `Message.subject` accessor, adapter bound at the `Chat._dispatch_to_handlers` convergence point. The GitHub/Linear adapter halves are blocked on native-client exposure (see Known Non-Parity rows).
- **`burst` concurrency strategy** (vercel/chat#495, PR #114). Hybrid of `debounce` and `queue`: idle threads coalesce a burst window into one dispatch with earlier messages in `context.skipped`; busy threads drain like `queue`. Note: upstream's PR title says "queue-debounce" but the shipped strategy string is `"burst"` — the Python port matches the string (cross-SDK config parity).
- **`process_message` returns the handler task** (core slice of vercel/chat#444). Streaming callers can await full handler completion and observe handler exceptions; `wait_until` keeps swallowed-error semantics; fire-and-forget callers are unaffected. The `@chat-adapter/web` package that motivated #444 is browser-only and not ported.
- **`chat/ai` subpath** (vercel/chat#492, design #109; PRs #116 + #122). `chat_sdk.ai` is now a package: `ai/messages.py` (`to_ai_messages`, moved with deprecation shims) and `ai/tools.py` — `create_chat_tools(chat, preset=, require_approval=, overrides=)` returning the 17 upstream tool factories as `ChatTool` dataclasses (JSON-Schema `input_schema`, async `execute`, `needs_approval`), keyed by upstream's camelCase tool ids. No new runtime dependencies.

### New adapter: Messenger (Meta)

- **`chat_sdk.adapters.messenger`** (vercel/chat#461, design #110; PRs #118 + #124). Full Messenger Platform adapter: GET verification handshake + `X-Hub-Signature-256` HMAC verification, Graph API client with typed error mapping, text/Generic/Button-template sends with documented caps, buffered streaming (no edit API), postback/reaction/delivery/read handlers, attachment extraction with lazy `fetch_data`, local message cache backing `fetch_messages`. New extra: `chat-sdk-python[messenger]`. Capabilities matrix in the design issue; `get_user` tracked as #132.

### Upstream parity ports — adapters

- **Slack: `webhook_verifier` now takes precedence over `signing_secret`** (vercel/chat#468, PR #113). Reverses the 0.4.27 precedence after upstream reversed itself; see the Known Non-Parity row update. **Migration**: if you relied on `signing_secret` shadowing a configured `webhook_verifier`, remove one of the two.
- **Slack: native `markdown_text` for outgoing messages** (vercel/chat#440). Outgoing posts use Slack's native markdown rendering instead of the legacy Block Kit conversion (deferred from 0.4.27).
- **Slack: external installation providers for bot token management** (vercel/chat#467). Pluggable multi-workspace token source composing with the existing dynamic `bot_token` resolver (per-request ContextVar caching preserved).
- **Slack: `web_client` property** (vercel/chat#471/#476/#478, PR #127). Sync `slack_sdk.WebClient` bound to the request-context token; `client` retained as a one-release deprecated alias.
- **Teams: outbound file delivery via data-URI activity attachments** (PR #125, ports upstream `filesToAttachments`). Execution artifacts now reach Teams; `edit_message` delivery is a documented deliberate superset.
- **Telegram: `video_note` extraction + typed attachment uploads** (vercel/chat#457, #485; PR #119).
- **Discord: handle interactions in gateway-only mode** (vercel/chat#490).
- **Adapter hardening pass** (slices of upstream `9824d33`): Slack timing-safe socket-token comparison (PR #126), GitHub eager bot-user-ID auto-detection (PR #128), Linear OAuth tokens encrypted at rest with AES-256-GCM (PR #129), and Google Chat fail-closed webhook verification (PR #130 — **breaking** for gchat configs that previously constructed without any verification gate; set `google_chat_project_number`, `pubsub_audience`, or the explicit `disable_signature_verification=True` escape hatch).

### Documentation alignment

- **DM routing precedence docstrings** (vercel/chat#491, PR #121). `on_direct_message` and `Thread.subscribe` docstrings now state the DM > subscribed > mention > pattern precedence the runtime already implemented; regression test pins DM > pattern.
- **Streaming docstring refresh** (vercel/chat#463, PR #123). `StreamingPlanOptions.update_interval_ms` and `ThreadImpl._handle_stream` no longer imply a binary native-vs-fallback split.

### Python-only improvements

- **Slack `files_upload_v2` confirmation surfaced through `post()`** (PR #117; also shipped early as 0.4.27.1). `SentMessage.raw` carries `uploaded_file_ids`; history persistence nulls `raw` to avoid storage bloat/PII.
- **Slack: DM block-action responses no longer thread** (PR #137, supersedes #133). `_handle_block_actions` mirrors `_handle_message_event`'s DM handling so HITL button replies don't create phantom "1 reply" threads.

### Not ported / deferred (documented in docs/UPSTREAM_SYNC.md)

- **`@chat-adapter/web`** (vercel/chat#444) — browser-only; no Python runtime.
- **`@chat-adapter/tests` kit** (vercel/chat#470) — `chat_sdk.testing` already covers the surface; row added.
- **GitHub `octokit` / Linear `linear_client` getters** (vercel/chat#459/#478 halves) — both Python adapters are hand-rolled over `aiohttp` with no SDK object to expose; rows added with the revisit conditions (`githubkit` adoption / an official Linear Python SDK).
- **Teams migration to `microsoft-teams-apps`** (issue #93) — explicitly deferred to the 0.4.30 cycle; row added. The 3.12 floor prerequisite (#111) shipped in this release.

### Build / infra

- **Python floor bumped 3.10 → 3.12** (PR #111).
- **Fidelity**: CI re-pinned to `chat@4.29.0`; `MAPPING` updated for the 4.29 layout (`ai.test.ts` split into `ai/messages.test.ts` + `ai/index.test.ts`) and extended to the new core test files; converter-exact test renames in `tests/test_ai_tools.py`; two `chat.test.ts` subject-rehydration ports are `skipif`-gated on `BaseAdapter.fetch_subject` and activate automatically when PR #131 lands.
- **Next wave**: upstream `chat@4.30.0` (tagged 2026-06-01) is tracked in #135.

## 0.4.27.1 (2026-05-29)

Python-only point release on the 0.4.27 line (branched from `v0.4.27`; shipped via tag `v0.4.27.1` + merged PR #117). Backports the Slack `files_upload_v2` confirmation fix (PR #117) so `SentMessage.raw` carries `uploaded_file_ids`, plus the history-persistence `raw` null-out. Shipped ahead of 0.4.29 to unblock chinchill-api's delivery-confirmation gating.

## 0.4.29a2 (2026-05-28)

Python-only fix. No upstream version change.

### Fixes

- **Slack now surfaces `files_upload_v2` confirmation through `post()`** — `SlackAdapter._upload_files` already computed the list of Slack-confirmed file IDs but `post_message` discarded the return, and `ThreadImpl._create_sent_message` hardcoded `raw=None`, so the confirmation never reached `SentMessage.raw`. Slack was the only file-capable adapter to drop this; discord/telegram upload inline and expose the platform response naturally. `post_message` now augments `RawMessage.raw` with `"uploaded_file_ids"` on every return path that can carry files (file-only, card, table, text), and `ThreadImpl._create_sent_message` accepts and propagates the adapter's `raw` into `SentMessage.raw`. `None` means no upload occurred; an empty list signals Slack confirmed zero attachments. The `raw` payload is augmented, not replaced, so existing consumers are unaffected. Unblocks chinchill gating UX on actual delivery success. An upstream `vercel/chat` issue is filed in parallel for convergence.

### Test quality

- Added 4 tests: three in `tests/test_slack_api.py` (file-only, text+files, and text-only-no-augment paths) and one end-to-end `tests/test_thread_faithful.py` test verifying `post()` propagates `RawMessage.raw` to `SentMessage.raw`.

## 0.4.29a1 (2026-05-28)

Alpha sync starter for upstream `4.29.0` (`vercel/chat` release commit
`6581d31`, May 18 2026). Upstream skipped tagging `chat@4.27.0` and
`chat@4.28.0` (only `@chat-adapter/shared@4.27.0` and `@chat-adapter/shared@4.28.0`
got tags); `chat@4.29.0` is the next real tag and the target of this
wave. **No feature ports in this release** — parity-bookkeeping bump
that sets `UPSTREAM_PARITY = "4.29.0"` and lays out the porting plan
below.

Each substantive commit lands as its own PR (matching the cadence used
during the 4.27 sync: #83, #85, #86, #87, #88, #89, #90, #91, #92, #99,
#101, #103, #104, #105). Tracking issue: #98.

### Behavior changes (Slack)

- **`webhook_verifier` now takes precedence over `signing_secret`** (vercel/chat#468, commit `0f0c203`). When a Slack adapter is constructed with both `webhook_verifier` and `signing_secret` (or with `webhook_verifier` while `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET` is set in the env), the verifier wins and the signing-secret path is dropped entirely. This **reverses** the precedence the Python port shipped in 0.4.27 (PR #87), which preferred `signing_secret` to match upstream's intent at that time. Upstream reversed itself in vercel/chat#468 (`chat@4.29.0`) so an env-configured `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET` could not silently shadow a verifier the caller wired up; this port now follows. **Migration:** if you relied on a configured `signing_secret` overriding `webhook_verifier`, drop the `webhook_verifier` from your `SlackAdapterConfig` (or, if you wired the verifier in deliberately, your signing-secret path is now correctly inert and you can remove it). The built-in HMAC + 5-minute timestamp tolerance only applies on the signing-secret path; verifier implementers remain responsible for replay protection (`slack/types.py` SECURITY contract).

### Sync scope (37 substantive upstream commits between `f55378a..chat@4.29.0`)

#### Core (`packages/chat`)

- [ ] **`chat/ai` subpath for AI SDK utilities** (vercel/chat#492). New
  public API surface: `createChatTools`, `toAiMessages` for LLM/agent
  integration. Vercel AI SDK is TS-only; the Python equivalent needs a
  design call (see open question). Likely the biggest single PR in the
  wave.
- [ ] **`queue-debounce` concurrency strategy** (vercel/chat#495). New
  strategy beyond the existing `drop` / `queue` / `debounce` /
  `concurrent`.
- [ ] **Transcripts API + per-thread cache rename to `threadHistory`**
  (vercel/chat#448). New API surface; the cache rename has chinchill-api
  blast radius.
- [ ] **`callbackUrl` on buttons and modals** (vercel/chat#454).
- [ ] **`message.subject` + adapter client access** (vercel/chat#459).

#### All adapters

- [ ] **`adapter.client` rename → `adapter.octokit` / `adapter.linearClient`
  / `adapter.webClient`** (vercel/chat#478). Public API rename across
  all adapters; deprecation shims advisable for one release.
- [x] **`private` → `protected` for subclassing** (vercel/chat#475).
  Already addressed — Python convention uses `_underscore` (de-facto
  protected); audit confirmed no `__name_mangled` internals across all
  8 adapters. No work needed.

#### Slack (`packages/adapter-slack`)

- [ ] **Native `markdown_text` for outgoing messages** (vercel/chat#440).
  Was listed as "deferred" in 0.4.27.
- [ ] **External installation provider for bot token management**
  (vercel/chat#467). Multi-workspace token mgmt extension.
- [ ] **Flip `webhook_verifier > signing_secret` precedence**
  (vercel/chat#468). Our 0.4.27 explicitly went the other direction
  ("match upstream" intent, with comment). Upstream has since reversed
  itself in #468. The comment on `adapter.py:385` is now stale; flip
  precedence + refresh comment + update tests.
- [ ] **Expose direct `WebClient` via `adapter.client`** (vercel/chat#471,
  reverted in #472, reapplied in #476). Pairs with the #478 rename.

#### Discord (`packages/adapter-discord`)

- [ ] **Handle interactions in gateway-only mode** (vercel/chat#490).
  Related to issue #57 (Discord native Gateway). Decide if Gateway
  support lands in this wave or stays on a separate track.

#### Telegram (`packages/adapter-telegram`)

- [ ] **Typed attachment uploads** (vercel/chat#485). Bundled with
  related Telegram polish.
- [ ] **`video_note` (round video messages) in `extractAttachments`**
  (vercel/chat#457).
- [x] **MarkdownV2 entity safety trim to streaming chunks**
  (vercel/chat#446). Already addressed in our 0.4.27 — the
  `_trim_to_markdown_v2_safe_boundary` / `_find_unclosed_link_dest_open_bracket`
  / `_slice_to_utf16_units` helpers from PR #89 cover this. No work
  needed.

#### Teams (`packages/adapter-teams`)

- [ ] **Migrate to `microsoft-teams-apps` SDK** (issue #93). Replaces our
  hand-rolled Bot Framework REST streaming with `ctx.stream.emit()`.
  Requires Python 3.12 floor bump. Headline Teams change for this wave
  (or 0.4.29.1 if the migration slips).

#### New packages

- [ ] **`@chat-adapter/messenger`** (vercel/chat#461). Brand-new Meta
  Messenger Platform adapter. Similar scope to porting WhatsApp or
  Telegram from scratch — own file tree under `src/chat_sdk/adapters/messenger/`,
  full webhook / message / attachment surface, ~1,500 LOC estimate.
- [⏭️] **`@chat-adapter/web`** (vercel/chat#444). Vue + Svelte browser
  UI for chat-sdk bots. **Out of scope** — no browser runtime in
  chat-sdk-python.
- [ ] **`@chat-adapter/tests` test kit** (vercel/chat#470). Test
  utilities for adapter authors. We already have an adapter-test
  pattern; evaluate whether to mirror.

#### Out of scope for this Python port

- **`@chat-adapter/web`** as above.
- **Documentation site changes** — `apps/docs/`, MDX refreshes, etc.
- **Vercel-specific release/CI automation** (#465, #466, #511, #512,
  #520).

### Open questions (resolve before implementation)

1. **`chat/ai` subpath — Python design.** Detailed scoping in design
   issue (see below). Recommended shape: shared SDK-agnostic core in
   `chat_sdk/ai/tools.py` + thin per-SDK adapters (Anthropic, OpenAI)
   via optional extras (`chat-sdk-python[ai-anthropic]`,
   `chat-sdk-python[ai-openai]`). 17 tool factories + the existing
   `to_ai_messages` (already in `chat_sdk/ai.py`). ~7 engineer-days.
   Three sub-questions: approval-flow contract, hand-written JSON
   Schema vs Pydantic v2, ship OpenAI extras in first cut?
2. **Messenger adapter (vercel/chat#461) — Python port.** Detailed
   scoping in design issue (see below). Mirrors WhatsApp adapter
   conventions; ~1,500 LOC prod + ~2,500 LOC tests; 2 PRs (scaffolding
   then adapter); ~5–6 days. Three sub-questions: init-failure
   semantics, postback `value` passthrough, signature-failure HTTP
   status code (upstream returns 403, our other adapters return 401).
3. **Cadence**: ship as one wave (4.27 → 4.29) or split into 0.4.28
   then 0.4.29?
4. **Python floor bump to 3.12** (required for Teams SDK migration —
   issue #93). Confirm chinchill-api compatibility before committing.
5. **Discord Gateway scope**: ship Gateway support in this wave
   (issue #57) or keep gateway-only mode fix (vercel/chat#490)
   isolated?
6. **`adapter.client` rename**: ship deprecation shim for one release,
   or hard cutover?

### Workflow

1. This alpha PR establishes the sync. CI on this draft is intentionally
   not invoked (lint.yml is gated on `!github.event.pull_request.draft`).
2. Each item above lands as its own PR. Each port PR:
   - Updates the relevant `MAPPING` / fidelity coverage and removes its
     entries from `scripts/fidelity_baseline.json` if previously baselined.
   - Bumps lint.yml's pinned upstream ref to `chat@4.29.0` (the new tag)
     once the first feature port lands.
   - Adds an entry under the next CHANGELOG heading (`0.4.29a2`,
     `0.4.29a3`, …).
3. Once all items are ported (or explicitly documented as divergence in
   `docs/UPSTREAM_SYNC.md`), the final PR cuts `0.4.29` and switches CI
   back to strict fidelity at the upstream tag.

## 0.4.27 (2026-05-28)

Synced to upstream `vercel/chat@4.27.0` (release commit `f55378a`, Apr 30 2026). Highlights: Slack Socket Mode + dynamic bot-token resolver, Teams native DM streaming, `chat.get_user()` across all 8 adapters, Telegram MarkdownV2 rendering, and a sweep of adapter bug fixes. Sets `UPSTREAM_PARITY = "4.27.0"`.

### Upstream parity ports

#### Core (`packages/chat`)

- **`Chat.get_user(adapter, user_id)`** for cross-platform user lookups (#90, vercel/chat#391). Returns `User | None` with `email`, `display_name`, `avatar_url`, `is_bot` populated from each platform's user-lookup API. Every adapter exposes `async def get_user(user_id)`; Telegram is best-effort (`getChat` only), WhatsApp returns minimal user info (Cloud API has no separate lookup).
- **`ExternalSelect.initial_option` + `option_groups`** (#84, vercel/chat#410, #397). Type extensions on `ExternalSelect`; Slack adapter serializes `option_groups` to Block Kit.
- **`concurrency.max_concurrent` honored in `concurrent` strategy** (vercel/chat#419) — already enforced in the Python port via `asyncio.Semaphore`; upstream has caught up. Divergence row in `docs/UPSTREAM_SYNC.md` downgrades from "silent correctness bug upstream" to "behavior parity restored".

#### Slack (`packages/adapter-slack`)

- **Socket Mode transport** (#86, vercel/chat#162). New `SlackAdapterConfig(mode="socket", app_token="xapp-...")` opens a persistent WebSocket via `slack_sdk.socket_mode.aiohttp.SocketModeClient`. Outer reconnect loop (1s → 30s exp backoff, 250ms shutdown poll) layered on top of the SDK's auto-reconnect. Forwarded-events receiver in `handle_webhook` for the serverless variant (`x-slack-socket-token`, `hmac.compare_digest`). `ModalResponse(action="clear")` lands too. New optional extra: `chat-sdk-python[slack-socket]`. Closes #68.
- **Dynamic `bot_token` resolver + custom `webhook_verifier`** (#87, vercel/chat#421). `bot_token` now accepts `str | Callable[[], str | Awaitable[str]]`; resolver is invoked per request and cached in a per-instance ContextVar so concurrent webhooks don't share tokens. `webhook_verifier` replaces built-in HMAC + timestamp verification (returning a `str` substitutes the canonical body). `signing_secret` precedence over `webhook_verifier` preserved. `schedule_message().cancel()` and `Attachment.fetch_data` are rotation-safe. New `SlackAdapter.current_token_async()` for cron-style callers outside `handle_webhook`.
- **Slack streaming team_id fix for interactive payloads** (#85, vercel/chat#330). `recipient_team_id` extraction now walks `team_id` → `team` (string) → `team.id` (object) → `user.team_id` in order, returning `None` only when no string ID is found. Previously the entire `team` dict was forwarded for `block_actions`, breaking streaming routing.
- **Link-preview unfurl enrichment** (#89, vercel/chat#395). `message_changed` events are routed through a new `_handle_message_changed` handler with a 2s poll window and per-event link cache (1h TTL), so the message handler sees enriched links.
- **`@mention` regex preserves email addresses** (#91, vercel/chat#394). The `@user` matcher now skips `@` characters inside email localparts.
- **Empty `thread_ts` guard** (#89, vercel/chat#292). `stream()` now degrades to a single `post_message` for empty `thread_ts` instead of raising — top-level Slack DMs encode thread IDs with an empty `thread_ts` by design, and the old `ValidationError` silently dropped the reply.

#### Teams (`packages/adapter-teams`)

- **Native streaming for DMs via emit** (#88, vercel/chat#416). DM threads use the Bot Framework streaming protocol (`channelData.streamType=streaming` + `streamSequence`, then a final `streamType=final` message); group chats accumulate and post once (matches upstream's flicker-free behavior). New `TeamsAdapterConfig.native_stream_min_emit_interval_ms` (default 1500ms) honors Teams' ~1 req/sec quota; `StreamOptions.update_interval_ms` overrides. Send-failure mid-stream cancels the session and re-raises so `Thread.stream` history matches user-visible text. Migration to `microsoft-teams-apps` (Python SDK, GA 2026-05-01) tracked as #93 for 0.4.28.
- **DM conversation ID resolution for Graph API** (#85, vercel/chat#403). Bot Framework opaque DM IDs are rejected by Graph's `/chats/{chat-id}/messages` endpoint; the adapter now caches the user's `aadObjectId` from inbound activities into a `TeamsDmContext` keyed by base conversation ID and resolves to the canonical `19:{userAadId}_{botId}@unq.gbl.spaces` form on Graph calls.

#### Telegram (`packages/adapter-telegram`)

- **MarkdownV2 rendering** (#89, vercel/chat#407). Replaces the legacy `Markdown` parse_mode with `MarkdownV2`. Three escape contexts (normal text, code blocks, inline-link URLs) handle the spec's 18-char escape set per region.

#### Discord (`packages/adapter-discord`)

- **Card text deduplication** (#89, vercel/chat#256). Card posts omit `content` on create (Discord renders both `content` and the embed otherwise); edits explicitly send `content: ""` so leftover text from a previous edit is cleared.

### Python-only improvements

- **Markdown parser completeness** (#101). GFM task lists (`- [ ]` / `- [x]` → `checked: bool`), backslash-escaped delimiters (lookbehind `(?<!\\)` on inline regexes), inline math (`$x$`) preserved by `_remend` and the format converter. Sentinel-based escape protection prevents pathological backslash sequences from being eaten by emphasis/strikethrough regexes.
- **Streaming markdown list-marker awareness + table chunk-boundary** (#99, issue #69). `_get_committable_prefix` knows about list-marker positions so a chunk boundary lands cleanly; tables that span chunk boundaries are wrapped so the first chunk doesn't ship a half-table.
- **`SlackAdapter._upload_files`** uses `channel=` not `channel_id=` for `files_upload_v2` (#103, issue #102). The underlying `files_completeUploadExternal` forwards `channel_id=channel` internally, so caller-supplied `channel_id=` collided and raised `TypeError` on every Slack file upload.
- **Adapter dict-StreamChunk support** (#105). `slack`, `github`, and `google_chat` stream loops now honor the dict-shaped `{"type": "markdown_text", ...}` chunks that `thread.py`'s `_from_full_stream` has always forwarded (Teams already honored). Slack `send_structured_chunk` rewritten with a `_read()` helper for dict/dataclass uniformity; fallback warning message rewritten to name the actual possible causes.
- **Google Chat card text rendering** (#92). `GoogleChatFormatConverter` now uses the full markdown parser for card text (was a regex stub that dropped formatting).
- **Adapter init logs + adapter-list in not-found errors** (#104). `GoogleChatAdapter.initialize()` and `GitHubAdapter.initialize()` now log on init (matching Slack/Teams). `Chat.channel()` / `Chat.thread()` "adapter not found" errors append `(registered adapters: [...])` so operators can disambiguate "never constructed" from "wrong lookup name".

### Sync-process documentation

- **Review-loop discipline** (`docs/UPSTREAM_SYNC.md`, `docs/SELF_REVIEW.md`). Codifies the lessons learned from this wave: self-review before opening the PR (cheaper than bot rounds), trace fix cascades across overlapping PRs, prefer official SDKs over hand-rolled implementations, cap drafts to 3–4 in flight, divergence budget of ≤2 per sync PR. `docs/SELF_REVIEW.md` adds adversarial check categories (input sweeps, emit/parse symmetry, pass-interaction, unforgeable sentinels, rebind/state coherence).

### Upstream items not ported

- **`@chat-adapter/web`** (Vue + Svelte browser UI, vercel/chat#444) — no browser runtime in chat-sdk-python.
- **Teams SDK 2.0.8 + `User-Agent` header** (vercel/chat#415) — JS-only. The Python Teams adapter uses raw `aiohttp`, not `botbuilder`; tracked in `docs/UPSTREAM_SYNC.md` non-parity table as a deferred enhancement.
- **Bundled guide markdown + templates manifest** (vercel/chat#423) — TS-monorepo authoring resources, not runtime behavior.

### Upstream tagging note

Upstream cut versions for the entire monorepo on Apr 30 2026 (commit `f55378a`), but only `@chat-adapter/shared@4.27.0` got a git tag — no `chat@4.27.0` tag was published. The fidelity workflow (`scripts/verify_test_fidelity.py`, `.github/workflows/lint.yml`) stays pinned to `chat@4.26.0` for this release; it'll move to a 4.27 SHA pin (or a real tag if upstream publishes one) in the next sync.

## 0.4.26.3 (2026-05-07)

Python-only fix. No upstream version change.

### Fixes

- **`SlackFormatConverter.render_postable` now uses the AST path for all markdown inputs** (issue #81). Previously, `PostableMarkdown` and `{"markdown": ...}` dict inputs were routed through a private regex helper (`_markdown_to_mrkdwn`) that truncated URLs containing parentheses and diverged silently from the TS SDK's `fromAst(parseMarkdown(text))` behavior. Both branches now call `from_markdown`, which goes through the AST. `str` and `raw` branches are unchanged.

### Structural parity

- **Deleted `_markdown_to_mrkdwn`** — a regex-based private method with no call sites after the fix above. The TS SDK has no equivalent; its presence was an undocumented divergence. Removes a confusing dead-code path and restores structural parity with `adapter-slack/src/markdown.ts`.

### Additions

- **`render_postable` now handles card and object-with-ast inputs** — added `{"card": ...}` dict, `{"type": "card", ...}` `CardElement` dict, `{"ast": ...}` dict, and `.card` / `.ast` attribute branches, plus `str(message)` fallback for unrecognized types. Matches the full union of `AdapterPostableMessage` variants.

### Test quality

- Added 19 tests to `tests/test_slack_format.py` covering all `render_postable` branches, every `_node_to_mrkdwn` node type (heading, blockquote, thematic break, image with/without alt), the remaining `extract_plain_text` paths (strikethrough, bare URL, channel mentions), and `to_blocks_with_table` edge cases (non-dict AST, standalone table, column alignment).

## 0.4.26.2 (2026-04-24)

Parity catch-up with upstream `4.26.0`. No upstream version change.

### New public APIs

- **`Thread.get_participants()`**: returns unique non-bot, non-self authors
  who've posted in the thread. Seeds from `current_message.author` (if
  eligible), then iterates `all_messages()` and dedupes by `user_id`.
  Mirrors upstream TS `Thread.getParticipants()`. Issue #54.
- **`Chat.on_options_load(...)` + `Chat.process_options_load(...)`**: port of
  upstream `onOptionsLoad` / `processOptionsLoad` for handling
  external-select option-load events. Specific action IDs run before
  catch-all handlers; errors are logged and skipped so later handlers still
  get a chance. New public types: `OptionsLoadEvent`, `OptionsLoadHandler`.
- **Slack `block_suggestion` dispatch**: the Slack adapter now routes
  `block_suggestion` interactive payloads through `process_options_load`
  and serializes the result to a Slack options JSON response. The handler
  is raced against a 2.5s budget (`OPTIONS_LOAD_TIMEOUT_MS`); on timeout
  the response is empty options and the orphaned task still logs errors
  via `asyncio.shield`. Issue #50.
- **`IoRedisStateAdapter`**: `RedisStateAdapter` subclass defaulting to the
  `ioredis_` lock-token prefix used by upstream Vercel Chat's `ioredis`-backed
  state. Enables cross-runtime Redis sharing between TS and Python chat-sdk
  deployments during migrations. Closes #71.
  Note: the token *shape* after the prefix diverges intentionally — Python
  emits `ioredis_{ms}_{hex32}` (`secrets.token_hex(16)`, CSPRNG) whereas
  upstream emits `ioredis_{ms}_{base36<=13}` (`Math.random().toString(36)`,
  not CSPRNG). Lock-release still works across runtimes because each
  runtime generates its own token on acquire and `release_lock` / `extend`
  compare the full token string — the divergence is observability-only
  (log lines, bytes-in-Redis), not a functional incompatibility. We will
  not regress to `Math.random()` for cosmetic byte-for-byte parity.
- **`RedisStateAdapter(token_prefix=...)`**: new `token_prefix` kwarg
  (default `"redis"`). Parameterizes the lock-token prefix for observability
  and interop.
- **`StreamingPlan` / `StreamingPlanOptions`** (`chat_sdk.plan`): a
  `PostableObject` wrapping an async iterable with platform-specific
  streaming options (`group_tasks`, `end_with`, `update_interval_ms`).
  Mirrors upstream `streaming-plan.ts`. Issue #56.
- **`Adapter.rehydrate_attachment` hook + `Attachment.fetch_metadata`**:
  port of upstream's `rehydrateAttachment` hook. `Chat._rehydrate_message`
  invokes the hook on every attachment that lost its `fetch_data` closure
  during a JSON roundtrip (queue / debounce / persistent state). The new
  serializable `fetch_metadata: dict[str, str] | None` field persists
  adapter-specific identifiers (Slack `url` + `teamId`, Teams `url`,
  Google Chat `resourceName` + `url`, Telegram `fileId`, WhatsApp
  `mediaId`). Implementations land on Slack, Teams, Google Chat, Telegram,
  and WhatsApp. Each rehydrate closure validates the target URL against a
  per-adapter allowlist before forwarding the auth token (SSRF defense).
  Closes #52.

### Upstream parity

- **Teams: `TeamsAuthCertificate` config shape** (Issue #58). Ports the
  upstream `TeamsAuthCertificate` interface (`adapter-teams/src/types.ts:3-10`)
  as a Python dataclass with `certificate_private_key`, `certificate_thumbprint`,
  and `x5c` fields. `TeamsAdapterConfig(certificate=...)` is accepted and
  re-exported from `chat_sdk.adapters.teams` so consumers can code against the
  shape ahead of MS Teams SDK support. Passing a non-`None` value still throws
  at adapter startup — the error message is now verbatim with
  `adapter-teams/src/config.ts:13-18` (`"Certificate-based authentication is
  not yet supported by the Teams SDK adapter. Use appPassword (client secret)
  or federated (workload identity) authentication instead."`). Not a functional
  implementation; upstream does not implement cert auth either.

### Test fidelity

- Ported the 4 `[getParticipants]` tests from `thread.test.ts` and the 4
  `[thread]` factory tests from `chat.test.ts` (existing-behavior coverage
  for `Chat.thread(id)`). Closes 8 fidelity gaps.
- Ported 19 `[post with Plan]` tests from `thread.test.ts` — closes #55.
- Ported 6 `[Streaming]` StreamingPlan option-variant tests from upstream
  `thread.test.ts` — closes #56.

### Fixes

- **`Plan.update_task(input)` now honors `input.id`** — previously only worked on the last in-progress task; with `id` set, targets that specific task and returns `None` for unknown IDs. Matches upstream `UpdateTaskInput` semantics.
- **`Plan.add_task()` / `update_task()` now propagate `adapter.edit_object` errors** — previously swallowed and logged; upstream returns the chained promise so callers see failures.
- **Plan edit queue is now actually sequential under concurrency** — previously racy under `asyncio.gather`; rewrote `_enqueue_edit` to build the chain synchronously before awaiting, matching upstream TS's `.then`-based chain. Fixes out-of-order edits when multiple `add_task`/`update_task` calls interleave.
- **`StreamingPlan` options now wired through `Thread.post()`** — the Python
  port was missing the `StreamingPlan` class entirely, so `group_tasks` /
  `end_with` / `update_interval_ms` were silently dropped (a plain async
  iterable was the only way to stream, and options went nowhere). Upstream
  already had the `kind === "stream"` branch that maps
  `groupTasks → taskDisplayMode`, `endWith → stopBlocks`, and
  `updateIntervalMs → updateIntervalMs` onto `StreamOptions` before invoking
  `adapter.stream(...)` or the fallback `post+edit` path. Issue #56.

### Test hygiene

- Sweep remaining `time.sleep` → `await asyncio.sleep` in async tests
  (`test_memory_state.py`, `test_state_postgres.py`). Closes the same
  flaky-test hazard fixed for the Redis backend in PR #73.

### CI / Internals

- `verify_test_fidelity.py` now enforces against upstream on every PR
  (`.github/workflows/lint.yml`); fails when the upstream clone is missing
  or when any mapped TS file can't be found. Workflow runs `--strict` and
  the clone step no longer carries `continue-on-error: true`, so infra
  failures surface immediately at the job level. Baseline shipped empty
  (all previously-missing tests ported in this release) — strict fidelity
  for *mapped core files* (8 of 17 `packages/chat/src/*.test.ts` files;
  see the `MAPPING` dict in `scripts/verify_test_fidelity.py` for the
  authoritative scope list). Closes #53.

## 0.4.26.1 (2026-04-23)

Python-only follow-up on `0.4.26`. Still alpha — APIs may change.

### Fixes

- **Slack native streaming**: `SlackAdapter.stream()` no longer calls
  `AsyncWebClient.chat_stream(...)` without `await`. The unawaited coroutine
  returned a truthy object, and the first `streamer.append(...)` raised
  `AttributeError`, breaking native Slack streaming for any consumer using
  the default adapter. Issue #44.
- **Teams divider renders at non-zero height**: empty `Container` with
  `separator: True` rendered as zero-height in the Teams UI. Dividers
  between siblings now hoist `separator: True` onto the following element;
  a trailing divider emits a minimal non-empty Container. Issue #45.
- **`ConcurrencyConfig.max_concurrent` is now enforced**: consumers setting
  `concurrency=ConcurrencyConfig(strategy="concurrent", max_concurrent=N)`
  now actually get an `asyncio.Semaphore(N)` cap on in-flight handlers.
  Previously the field was accepted and ignored (upstream TS has the same
  gap). `None` / unset keeps the unbounded default. Issue #51.

### Python-specific (divergence from upstream 4.26)

- **Fallback streaming runtime robustness** (cluster of fixes): framework-
  agnostic `request.text()` handling now tolerates sync Flask-style
  requests (was raising `TypeError: object is not awaitable`). Handlers
  typed `Callable[..., Awaitable[None] | None]` may return sync (`None`) —
  the dispatcher now `await`s only when `inspect.isawaitable()` confirms,
  preventing runtime crashes on sync handlers.
- **`max_concurrent` enforcement** (see above) — upstream accepts the
  config field but never enforces it; we do.

### New public APIs

- **`Chat.thread(thread_id, *, current_message=None)`**: new worker-
  reconstruction factory mirroring TS `chat.thread(threadId)`. Adapter is
  inferred from the thread-ID prefix; state and message history come from
  the Chat instance. `current_message` is preserved so Slack native
  streaming still works post-reconstruction. Issue #46.
- **`SlackAdapter.current_token` / `current_client`**: public `@property`
  accessors for the request-context-bound bot token and a preconfigured
  `AsyncWebClient`. Replaces underscore access from consumer code making
  direct Slack Web API calls inside a handler (email resolution, user
  profile fetches, etc.). Issue #47.

### Internals

- **Pyrefly: 213 → 0 type errors**; baseline file removed. CI now enforces
  zero errors. Root causes fixed: 8-adapter `lock_scope: LockScope | None`
  protocol conformance; `_ChatSingleton` as `Protocol`; submodule-aware
  `replace-imports-with-any`; `NoReturn` on error re-raisers;
  `inspect.isawaitable` guards for duck-typed request handling and
  sync-or-async handler dispatch. No `Any` widening, no new `# type:
  ignore` lines beyond 10 at adapter event-construction sites where
  `thread=None`/`channel=None` get re-wrapped by `Chat` before handler
  dispatch (matches upstream TS's `Omit<>` partial-event pattern).
- Test count: **3545 passed**, 2 skipped.

### Known gaps (not fixed in this release)

- `onOptionsLoad` handler for dynamic select dropdowns — issue #50
- `Thread.getParticipants()` method — issue #54
- `rehydrate_attachment` adapter hook for queue/debounce + attachments —
  issue #52
- 40 upstream tests without Python equivalents (Options Load, Plan variants,
  StreamingPlan options, getParticipants) — issue #53
- Discord native Gateway WebSocket (HTTP-only today) — issue #57
- Teams certificate-based mTLS auth — issue #58
- Google Chat file uploads (TODO upstream too) — issue #59
- Global handler-dispatch bound across reactions/actions/slash/modals — issue #61

## 0.4.26 (2026-04-16)

Synced to [Vercel Chat 4.26.0](https://github.com/vercel/chat).

### New features (from upstream 4.26.0)
- **Standalone `reviver`**: new top-level `chat_sdk.reviver` function for deserializing `Thread`, `Channel`, and `Message` objects without importing a `Chat` instance. Designed for Vercel Workflow step functions and any environment where pulling adapter dependencies is undesirable. Use it as `json.loads(payload, object_hook=reviver)`. Lazy adapter resolution: `chat.register_singleton()` / `chat.activate()` must still be called before thread methods like `post()` are invoked.
- **Workflow-safe `to_json()`**: `Thread.to_json()` and `Channel.to_json()` now prefer the stored `_adapter_name` over `self.adapter.name`, so objects revived without a singleton can still be re-serialized.

### Fixes (from upstream 4.26.0)
- **Fallback streaming no longer edits/posts empty content**: `Thread.post(stream)` on adapters without native streaming no longer sends `{markdown: ""}` during the LLM warm-up or when a chunk buffers to whitespace. Empty streams with placeholders disabled now post a single space rather than an empty string (a non-empty `SentMessage` is required by the stream contract).
- **Slack empty header cells**: Markdown tables with an empty header cell now render as a single space in the Slack table block instead of being rejected by the Slack API. Replaces a truthiness-based fallback with an explicit length check, matching upstream.
- **Google Chat custom link labels**: `[Click here](https://example.com)` now renders as `<https://example.com|Click here>` (Google Chat's supported custom-label syntax) instead of `Click here (https://example.com)`.

### Python-specific (divergence from upstream 4.26)
- **Fallback streaming clears stranded placeholders**: when a stream produces only whitespace with the default placeholder enabled, the final edit replaces `"..."` with `" "` so the message doesn't render as permanently loading. Upstream 4.26 intentionally leaves the placeholder visible to avoid empty-edit API calls; we issue one final edit to `" "` instead. Documented under [Known Non-Parity](docs/UPSTREAM_SYNC.md#known-non-parity-with-typescript-sdk).
- **Google Chat `<url|text>` round-trip**: upstream 4.26 emits Google Chat's custom-label link syntax in the outgoing direction but doesn't parse it back in `to_ast()` / `extract_plain_text()`. A `[label](url)` posted through the gchat adapter would round-trip back as raw `"<url|label>"` text with no link node, breaking downstream handlers. We added the inverse regex to close the round-trip. Documented under Known Non-Parity.
- **`from_json(data, adapter=X)` syncs `_adapter_name`**: upstream leaves `_adapterName` at the payload value even when an explicit adapter is bound, so `to_json()` can emit a stale name that refers to a different adapter than what runtime calls use. We update `_adapter_name = adapter.name` on explicit rebind so serialize and runtime stay consistent. Documented under Known Non-Parity.
- **Google Chat `<url|text>` emit falls back to `text (url)` when it can't round-trip**: the custom-label syntax is only safe when the label doesn't contain `|` / `>` / `]` / newline, the label is non-empty, and the URL has an RFC 3986 scheme and no `|` or `>`. Upstream unconditionally emits `<url|text>`, producing malformed output for the edge cases. We fall back to `text (url)` (or bare URL for empty labels) so the content survives the round-trip and Google Chat's auto-link detection still fires for http(s) URLs. Documented under Known Non-Parity.
- **Google Chat headings render as bold**: `#` / `##` / etc. emit as `*text*` for visual distinction. Upstream falls through to plain-text concatenation and loses the visual hierarchy entirely. Google Chat has no heading syntax, and bold is the closest approximation the platform supports. Documented under Known Non-Parity.
- **Google Chat images render as `{alt} ({url})` (or bare URL)**: upstream has no image branch — the default fallback concatenates children only and silently drops the URL. We preserve the URL so the content isn't lost. Documented under Known Non-Parity.
- **Fallback streaming captures stream exceptions and flushes before re-raising**: if the text stream iterator raises mid-flight (e.g. LLM connection drops), `_fallback_stream` now awaits `pending_edit`, flushes whatever partial content was rendered, clears the placeholder if appropriate, and THEN re-raises the original exception. Upstream propagates immediately, orphaning `pendingEdit` as a background task and stranding `"..."` on the message. Documented under Known Non-Parity.
- **Fallback streaming final SentMessage carries repaired markdown**: the returned `SentMessage.markdown` is `renderer.finish()` output (`_remend`'d — inline markers auto-closed). Upstream ships raw `accumulated`. Narrow UX refinement — unobservable unless the stream ends mid-marker. Documented under Known Non-Parity.

## 0.4.25 (2026-04-10)

Synced to [Vercel Chat 4.25.0](https://github.com/vercel/chat). New versioning: `0.{upstream_major}.{upstream_minor}` embeds the upstream version directly.

### New features (from upstream 4.25.0)
- **Plan blocks**: `Plan` PostableObject for structured task lists with live updates. Post a plan to a thread, then `add_task()`, `update_task()`, and `complete()` with automatic card rendering.
- **Streaming table option**: `StreamingMarkdownRenderer(wrap_tables_for_append=False)` disables code-fence wrapping for platforms with native table support. Slack adapter now uses this by default.
- **Teams Select/RadioSelect**: `Select` and `RadioSelect` card elements now render as Adaptive Card `Input.ChoiceSet` with auto-injected submit button.
- **GitHub issue threads**: `issue_comment` webhooks on plain issues (not just PRs) now create threads with format `github:owner/repo:issue:42`.
- **Slack OAuth redirect fix**: `handle_oauth_callback` correctly forwards `redirect_uri` option.

### Versioning
- Version scheme changed from `0.0.1aX` to `0.{upstream_major}.{upstream_minor}[.patch]`
- `UPSTREAM_PARITY` constant in `chat_sdk.__init__` for programmatic access
- Sync procedure documented in [UPSTREAM_SYNC.md](docs/UPSTREAM_SYNC.md)

## 0.0.1a12 (2026-04-10)

Python 3.10 support, async-safe Chat resolver, and a large correctness audit.

### Upgrading

**Python 3.10 is now supported.** CI tests 3.10 through 3.13.

**Breaking changes** (all alpha — no stable API guarantees yet):

- **Serialization keys are now camelCase** (`threadId`, `channelId`, `adapterName`) to match the TS SDK. `from_json()` accepts both camelCase and snake_case, so existing stored data still loads.
- **`PermissionError` → `AdapterPermissionError`**: the old name shadowed Python's builtin. If you import it, update the name.
- **`StateNotConnectedError`** replaces bare `RuntimeError` when calling state methods before `connect()`. Catch `StateNotConnectedError` instead of `RuntimeError`.
- **`OnLockConflict` callbacks** should return `"force"` or `"drop"` (strings). Returning `True` still works for backward compat but is deprecated.
- **`reviver()`** no longer registers a global singleton. Each reviver is bound to the Chat that created it.

### New: async-safe Chat resolver

Thread and Channel deserialization now supports three resolution levels:

```python
# 1. Explicit (best for library code, multi-tenant)
thread = ThreadImpl.from_json(data, chat=my_chat)

# 2. Context-local (best for tests, request scoping)
with chat.activate():
    thread = ThreadImpl.from_json(data)

# 3. Global (existing pattern, unchanged)
chat.register_singleton()
thread = ThreadImpl.from_json(data)
```

Concurrent async tasks using `activate()` are fully isolated — each task resolves its own Chat without interference.

### Bug fixes

- Fixed streaming: intermediate edits now use the markdown renderer (was sending raw text), paragraph separators between agent steps, 500ms latency on stream end eliminated
- Fixed all adapters: token refresh race conditions, HTTP session reuse (was creating one per request), `limit=0` no longer silently replaced by defaults
- Fixed serialization: Slack installations now interoperate with the TS SDK, card fallback text extracted properly, AI SDK field names corrected
- Fixed Teams: status code comparison, modal dialog buttons, table cell escaping
- Fixed shutdown: in-flight handler tasks are cancelled, fire-and-forget tasks tracked for GC safety

### Internals
